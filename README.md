##What is GIS anyways?

GIS, or geographic information system, is a method that utilizes maps to store information. This heavily relates to the nature of natural disaster as they usualy effect large numbers of people in a large area. It stands to reason then that GIS can allow us to locate most probable locations for hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanos, etc.
